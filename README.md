This repository contains files related to the prediction and validation of the dynamic characteristics of variable-temperature adsorption and desorption processes.

MATLAB file:
The MATLAB script implements the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) method to predict the dynamic behavior of the variable-temperature adsorption–desorption process.

Excel file – “脱附-开式-冷凝温度0-变量hvTq版本4”:
This file contains the original dataset computed using partial differential equations (PDEs), serving as the baseline data for model training and comparison.

Excel files – “脱附-开式-冷凝温度0-变量hvT-q” (and related versions):
These files contain high-density validation data, which were also obtained through PDE-based simulations and represent the true values used for assessing the prediction accuracy of the POD model.
